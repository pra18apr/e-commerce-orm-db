## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://dann-lam.github.io/e-commerce-orm-db/)

This is an ecommerce app that is a practice for the backend of an e-commerce styled website.

The challenges were creating the databases, creating the sequelize models, describing how relationships between the database models, and creating the routes for the API.

It's still quite early and not 100% fully fleshed out, later features will be more complete allowing users to delete users or departments or anything else.

## Learning Points

This has been a practice for ORM.
While it wasn't the most technically challenging, understanding the true depths of the content here is extremely deep.

There's a lot of aspects about this project that I'm not super comfortable with, however the core functionality is working.


Overrall, a great exercise in patience and learning, definitely the hardest one I've encountered so far.
